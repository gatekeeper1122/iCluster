## What is it?
iCLuster is a clean and informative analog speedometer and tachometer for the Stand mod menu in GTA V, along with realistic vehicle warning symbols such as TPMS, traction control, check engine, and more.
iCluster gives you the immersion when driving that GTA V never had.
Ditch your current badly-coded, reposted and stolen speedometer script and experience what you've been missing out on since the game came out. 

## Install
Drag everything except the readme.md and LICENSE.txt into your Lua Scripts folder. Done and done.
